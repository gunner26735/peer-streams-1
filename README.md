LivePeer's Usecase :<br>
-> The streamer can Live stream using Livepeer using the StreamID and the Stream URL which we are generating in our platform and then give that URL and ID to OBS and then the stream will be started.<br>
Lens Protocol Usecase :<br>
We are fetching Streamer's Publications on Lens subgraph and showing it here so that user can relate to streamers social life.<br>
XMTP :<br>
-> Users can <b>Video Chat and normal chat</b> using Livepeer and XMTP ,further we are thinking to make this a paid module in which user can chat with his favourite streamer after paying some price.<br>

ENS Usecase :<br>
-> We are Showing all the Wallet Address who are Subscribers of the Streamer and we are not showing their Wallet Address insted we are showing their ENS names(for those who have a ENS).<br>
IPFS usecase :<br>
-> IPFS is used to store Video Nfts of streamers which they select to mint.<br>
-> user can watch recording of livestreams which the streamer has minted on IPFS.<br>
Superfluid Usecase :<br>
-> We believe in Pay as you watch so the user has to pay for only time he/she/they have watched the stream.<br>
-> Eg: If the streamer has seen for 10 seconds than only that much amount will be paid.<br>
Push Usecase : <br>
-> Streamer can send notifiations to his subscribers when He/She starts a stream and that can directly be done on the same page as the stream,<br>
further the users can seethose notifications on our platform itself so that both entities don't have to go to any other platform.<br>
Polygon Usecase :<br>
-> We are using Polygon to store user and subscriber's data like subscribed channels,liked videos,like counts of a video,donations,channel bio.


<b><h2>Challenges we ran into</b></h2>
-> Getting the asset id after stream ends and minting it was a hard task for us but we conquered it as a team effort.
->Filecoin VM is quite new and it was good to explore it with the help of the Mentor .
